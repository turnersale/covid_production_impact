    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "As Covid-19 has ravaged much of the US economy, Company A has not been immune to the inevitable effects of a reduced labor force and impacted sales pipeline. The impacts of Covid-19 are clear to all observers, but the extent to which and the predictive capacity is not yet clear. This paper will be focused on determining the best model for predicting critical manufacturing success metrics using Covid-19 as part of the feature set. There are of course underlying patterns and trends inside the company (and internal projects to improve efficiency), but Covid-19 provides a new challenge. The impact of local, state, and regional cases, as well as governmental actions have led to an interesting new chapter in the company's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure the impacts of Covid-19 (as well as predict potential future impacts) data will be collected from the shipping and production areas of our manufacturing center. Quality metrics were initially considered as well, but there have been 2 major changes in the past 3 months which have led to the schema changing in accordance which have led to the conclusion that the data is not yet clean enough to be used for this purpose. The lack of history and continual shifts in Quality make it a harder metric to rely upon."

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this paper is to create a predictive model for on-time shipment with considerations for on-time comletion (of assembled goods). Shipments are the more critical factor as impacts there are more pronounced to the end customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model should have a high accuracy (target of 80%) in predicting on-time shipments and completions. Parsimony (as always) is preferred, but not a prerequisite. Models which are adaptable to future inputs are also preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Time Shipment\n",
    "\n",
    "On-Time Shipment is perhaps the most critical metric of factory success in our organization. It not only impacts the customer and their satisfaction, but also the ability for our shipping center to continue normal operations. With a JIT (Just In Time) manufacturing push over the past 2 years, we are more and more reliant on accurate and consistent shipping, as space and time are at a premium. This metric is more critical than On-Time Completion, in that it is more likely to affect future orders from customers, as well as recommendations/sales leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric is reliant upon the On-Time Completion from a process persepective, but supercedes it in importance to end users (and managers internally). \n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Time Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "The On-Time Completion metrics measure the performance of our Assembly group which feeds materials to the Shipping group. Without a stable assembly process, the Shipping group would be unable to handle the swings in volume. Therefor, we have begun the process of level loading with great success in process change and simplicity. This however does not always translate to success in the final results, especially during a time of crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This measure, and the On-Time Shipment metric as well, is broken into three main categories for greater clarity and utitlity (on-time, early and late). These two metrics combined should provide an interesting cross section of the business (for example, has Covid-19 had a greater impact on one or the other, or does the On-Time Completion metrics perhaps outweight Covid-19 as a predictor)."

    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary resources to be utilized are the Data Warehouse (inlcuding SQL Server resources) and Python. Both resources are available to the data scientist and require no additional cost. The time spent on this project is to be recorded for the purposes of Company A should they decide the effort was worthwhile, else the data scientist will absorb all costs associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary risk is low predictive value. There are no major costs or process stoppages that may impact this project. Additionally, all work is done with open source software or licensed enterprise tooling that is easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are no employee or other sensitive data sources and we do not have any constraints on data access other than the removal of costs fields. These fields are accessible to Company A employees but might not be appropriate for external viewing. The only major constraint is the accessibility of highly detailed Covid-19 data. This data is available on county and other such levels, but not city or personal levels. Thus we can only utilize the data available to the public.\n"

    "## Data Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Time Shipment\n",
    "\n",
    "On-Time Shipments data is readily available in the Data Warehouse as this information tracks every single shipment leaving our stock or facilities. These lines are created in the normal shipment process when a supervisor finalizes the shipment. This in turn creates a \"Packing Slip\" of the inventory being shipped, warehouse ledger entries (for stockkeeping) and most importantly: Sales Shipment Lines. These lines are the ones we are capturing for this analysis. Each line indicates a product in/on a shipping unit (pallet, box, etc.). This means that a single sales line may contain multiple shipments lines. This gives us the benefit of knowing if the status of each shipment, not just the collective status of a higher level lines (like sales lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume of data is roughly in the hundres to thousands of lines per working day. These lines are both highly accurate (as they determine certain accouting and stockkeeping functions) and are part of a now highly stable process. The quality of lines has dramatically improved over the past 2 years and the past 12 months (after transitioning to a new facility) have had very little noticeable error lines. The process also provides validity to the measurement, as this is a regularly measured feature of our company and is maintained and reviewed on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Time Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "On-Time Completion is a critical measure of assembly/production success. This metric is used both inside and outside the production group and provides valuable information regarding the ability and capacity at hand. Periods of high performance regularly reduce overhead while poor performance impacts both overhead and customer satisfaction. This data is on the magnitude of several hundred lines per day, depending heavily on the mix of product types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure On-Time Completion, we must capture the correct due date and the correct completion date. A unique aspect of our organization is the concept of a production order. These production orders contain one or more proucts of the same item number. This provides a way to consolidate the picking procedures and build the same product in sequence. This does however mean that we must consider the production order as completed only when all products related to it are complete. Because of this, we will be counting the number of prodction orders rather than the number of produced components inside of them. This is the standard for our organization internationally as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of claiming labor and outputing the final product is very stable in our production group. The quality is some of the highest outside the Finance realm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covid-19\n",
    "\n",
    "Covid-19 data is collected primarily through governmental organizations and distributed through groups like the CDC or universities like John's Hopkins University. This paper focuses on several components of Covid-19 data:\n",
    "- United States\n",
    "    - All cases and deaths\n",
    "    - New cases and deaths\n",
    "- Michigan\n",
    "    - All cases and deaths\n",
    "    - New cases and deaths\n",
    "    - Mask requirement orders\n",

    "    - Safer at home orders\n",
    "- Companu A's County\n",
    "    - All cases and deaths\n",
    "    - New cases and deaths\n",
    "\n",
    "These sources will be combined to provide a more detailed picture of the situation that Company A is working within. The inclusion of cases and deaths should provide direct impacts on population, while executive orders and governmental mandates should provide context to the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Granularity\n",
    "\n",
    "All data is collected and/or aggregated on a daily grain. Smaller grains are not pertinent to this analysis (hourly does not provide any benefit nor is the information available). Weekly aggregations may be of value as well, but in this case they are not considered. Additionally, non-working dates will be excluded. We do have times where overtime is required, but none of the processes are designed specifically for that in mind, thus it is always used as a \"makeup\" period.\n"

It is also entirely possible to break down this concept even further (to the work center, or building) but this would likely be less valuable information as workers can be moved between work centers, thus negating some of the largest swings. Further granularity would also require tooling other than SQL, as the pivoting/melting functions are not as robust (as can be seen in the somewhat convluded code below)."

The county level data available on their site is used both by the CDC and John's Hopkins University (both of which are leading the response to the pandemic). This data is collected in three main components: known cases, deaths, and county population. These three sets are imported (from csv that was downloaded from usafact.org with accurate data through 7/27) and then altered to provide the known cases and deaths for the US as a whole, for Michigan, and for Muskegon county (this is where Company A is located). They are also altered to give the relative cases and deaths per 100k population.\n"

    "The final dataset is a combination of all the above smaller datasets joined on the same date. This will allow for the discovery of relationships and creation of new features which otherwise would not be possible. In addition, it is important to consider the causal relationship between on-time completion and on-time shipment, they are not entirely 1:1 because we have a \"buffer\" period of typically two working days. This does mean though that when production is two or more days behind on a product, it almost inevitably leads to late shipments. This may be highly useful in prediction, but is something to keep an eye on."

    "Our best performing model was the third iteration of the Random Forest model (in this case it was a classification model). It appears that although there was very little data, the model was able to fairly accurately predict the outcomes. It may be possible to use bootstrapping to increase the accuracy, but it may come at the cost of overfitting the model. For the time being, this model will be the one considered as the final result. As this model is the best performer, is worth taking a look at some of the pieces more in depth.\n",

    "Here we can see which features have the highest importance (impurity based metrics provided by the model object returned using the sklearn package). Each one of the highest importance is interesting to consider:\n",
    "- Total Production Lines\n",
    "    - This is effectively the volume of production on that date that was completed. It is interesting to note that this relationship occurs, as it likely indicates a labor shortage or something of that nature. It is unlikely that the current day's production volume is directly affecting the outcomes of shipping, rather there is probably an unmeasured feature that impacts both.\n",
    "    - In future analysis the number of claimed labor hours or perhaps the sum of paid hours can be considered. This would show whether the production lines are directly affecting the shipping performance or if the labor availability is affecting both in the same manner.\n",
    "- National Case Increase Percent\n",
    "    - This feature is effectively demonstrating how much \"larger\" the pandemic is nationally compared to the previous day. Interestingly, it is highly correlated with the number of new national cases (as it is built on the number of new cases vs the previous number of cases) but is more stronly predictive of shipping outcomes.\n",
    "    - Perhaps inclusion of a local version would have similar effect, or perhaps the national situation dictates much of the societal impacts throughout the nation. \n",
    "- Total Time\n",
    "    - This is a metric very similar to Total Production Lines, but is a better indicator of the \"effort\" that day. It is a figure that relates all productions together based on a shared unit, whereas quantity can be easily swayed by quick to build but high quantity items.\n",
    "    - This could perhaps be removed or used as a replacement for Total Production Lines.\n",
    "- Prod Line Lag 2 and Prod Time Lag 2\n",
    "    - These features are interesting in combination as they actually show the impact of our buffer time (outbound warehouse handling as we call it) on the shipment performance. This must indicate that the day two days prior has a real impact on the performance while 1 and 3 day do not.\n",
    "    - It may be of value to include similarly lagged value for the raw production line count and the production time count, rather than just the on-time proportions. This would remove the assembly \"performance\" from consideration and replace it with assembly \"workload\" instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitions\n",
    "\n",
    "These finding would suggest that the intuitions shared across the company may have some validity, namely:\n",
    "- Production volume is a big determiner of shipping performance\n",
    "- Production performance can propogate to the shipping group\n",
    "- Covid-19 has had impacts when national cases are on the rise, but not directly due to mandates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Research\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not particularly surprising facts, as our business is an essential business, so very few workers were forced to stay at home even while mandates were in place. However, we did have massive labor shortages during the most extreme periods. Perhaps capturing labor usage/availability would be of use in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We additionally found that the productoin volumes had a significant impact, which may suggest that the shipping group is understaffed relative to the production group, or that the production group is simply able to handle higher workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that the availability of shipping capacity (from companies like XPO Logistics, Fedex, and UPS) may have been impacted during this time, holding us from shipping materials. In order to accomodate this possibility it would be worthwhile to collect shipping capacity data during the time period. This data is likely to be hard to come by though as much of it is proprietary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the inclusion of additional resource metrics may be of use, including:\n",
    "- Average/daily assembly labor capacity\n",
    "- Average/daily stockroom labor capacity\n",
    "- Average/daily open shipping space\n",
    "- Average/daily shipping space utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "These factors may round out the picture further by showing the physical capacities and limits that could directly impact shipping's ability to send material out on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the final model was not as accurate as desired, particularly in the \"Below Average\" predictions, the insights gained provide support for further examination. The most important features reinforced certain domain knowledge based conlusions, while also demonstrating space for improvement. Additional data (both externally and over the coming couple months) will be required in order to improve the model accuracy and predictive capacity."
